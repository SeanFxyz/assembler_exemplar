# *Assembler Exemplar* Wiki Documentation

## Background

This document seeks to explain the general layout and design of the wiki created
for *Assembler Exemplar*.

Files will be provided in Markdown

For all wiki documents including an "Operations" section, a reference will be
made below to *The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer
from First Principles* as published by The MIT Press in March of 2005. The name
of this source will be abbreviated to *The Elements of Computing Systems* for
the sake of brevity.

## General Layout

The layout for all entries within the wiki should align with the following
standards based on the directory the entry belongs to:

### Chips

1. A first-level header will specify the name of the entry
2. A second-level header titles "Description" will give a brief description of
the chip
3. A second-level header titled "Operations" will give the name, inputs,
outputs, and the chip's function or operation as specified in *The Elements of
Computing Systems*. The reference will be provided in the format:
    * Adapted from *The Elements of Computing Systems* Pg. [page number]
4. An optional second-level header titled "Additional Information" providing
comments or other useful information, potentially including objects such as
"truth tables"
